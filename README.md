# Image_Segmentation_Model
A Fully Convolutional Neural Network based model


In this project, a segmentation task has been performed for a small dataset. The dataset can be downloaded from this link (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0d9ZiqAgFkiOHR1NTJhWVJMNEU/view), which has been prepared by Divam Gupta.

A keras based FCN-8 architecture has been used for this task, which uses CNN to convert each of the image pixels to categories.For details of FCN-8, please refer to https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4038.

h5 weights of VGG-16 has been initialised at first. The model shows the Validation Accuracy of 78% and Validation Loss of 0.3
