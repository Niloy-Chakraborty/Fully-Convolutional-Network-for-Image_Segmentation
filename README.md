# Image_Segmentation_Model
A Fully Convolutional Neural Network based model


In this project, a segmentation task has been performed for a small dataset. The dataset can be downloaded from this link (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0d9ZiqAgFkiOHR1NTJhWVJMNEU/view), which has been prepared by Divam Gupta.

A keras based FCN-8 architecture has been used for this task. For details of FCN-8. please refer to https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4038.

A .h5 file for VGG-16 has been initialised at first.
